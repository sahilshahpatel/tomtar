                        Greetings! I am a graduate student in Interactive Media Technology at KTH. My contributions to the project were writing in the game design document and creating the environments in the game. This involved creating or acquiring 3D models, materials, and shaders for all scenes and creating an environment that increased player immersion.

                        I am currently in the first year of my Master's degree, studying Interactive Media Technology at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. 
                        I mainly do the design work for this project. I designed the poster of this game, designed the two characters, and also make the 3D model. 
                        This is the first time I try to make the animation function for the characters, I do face some difficult problems with it, and find that I still need to keep learning!

                        Salutations! I am a graduate student in Interactive Media Technology at KTH and had a blast working on this project!
                        Apart from contributing to the overall game design, I designed and built the layout of Level 1 and its puzzles, 
                        programmed several gameplay mechanics (such as the grappling hook), improved the character controller and was responsible for 
                        the lighting of Level 1 & 2. I also contributed to writing the game design document. You can read more about me and, hopefully,

                        I also developed this website and contributed to our game design document.

                <p>
                    <i>Tomtar</i> is a game aimed at younger children, likely below 16. The target audience is young children 
                    who have a sibling or close friend to play with. Another target market is parents who want to play together with their kids.

                <p>
                    The market for a game like <i>Tomtar</i> is only growing. Today's parent's are increasingly gamers themselves,
                    and want to use games to connect with their kids. Additionally, the success of titles like <i>It Takes Two</i> 
                    have massively expanded the market for cooperative games, even intriguing non-gamers.
